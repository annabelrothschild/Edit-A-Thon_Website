          <p class="lead mb-5">Today we'll talk about how to edit an infobox for a local newspaper on Wikipedia. We've got four main goals in this project: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Help make Google search engine a better tool for users to judge source credibility, by improving Wikipedia’s coverage of newspapers. Increasing the number of newspapers covered by Wikipedia can improve public web literacy, by making it easier for Google users to decipher credible news sources from bias or fake news. </li>
                <li>Help girls in Asia and Africa learn to read via the Room to Read foundation, through the generosity of Paul Haar and Susan Karp.</li>
                <li>Change the gender balance of editors in Wikipedia (in 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia">90% of editors were male</a>). Such a skewed gender representation affects what topics are written about. If more women and non-binary people become editors, Wikipedia will better reflect the issues and topics that are important to everyone.</li>
                <li>Build awareness of local newspaper culture and history!</li>
              </ol>

We’d love for you to contribute remotely, if you cannot attend the event in person! Please email us if this is the case. On the week of the event, we’ll send you a link to website that includes instructions on how to edit and keep track of your edits. 
(Eventually, our goal is for all participants to edit Wikipedia pages in their own time!)

              <h3 class="mb-0">Background</h3>
              <p>The #NOW (Newspapers on Wikipedia Project) was created by <a href="https://hapgood.us/2018/05/29/announcing-the-local-historical-newspapers-project-lhnp/">Mike Caulfield</a> after reading <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3201064.3201095">Investigating the Effects of Google's Search Engine Result Page in Evaluating the Credibility of Online News Sources</a>, written by Emma Lurie '19 and Dr. Eni Mustafaraj, of Wellesley's CS Department. As Caulfield writes, "The core of the paper is this — Lurie and Mustafaraj nudged students with prompts into using lateral reading on sources, and then watched how they performed. In doing so, they were able to identify the ways in which untutored lateral reading succeeds and how it fails. This close examination yields a variety of insights in what search platforms, media literacy teachers, researchers, and others can do to better support readers in this process, as well as noting some pitfalls of current online literacy advice." <br><br>Now, what does this have to do with Wikipedia? <br><br> In short, Wikipedia information is used to create Google's knowledge panels - what you see when you Google something like a newspaper. Having credible information in that knowledge panel is a good first step in lateral reading - or the process of researching a source or topic by looking for other information on the source. For example, if you encountered a fake news story from a bogus source, let's say the "CRED Lab Daily Tribune" and you weren't able to find anything proving the legitimacy of the "CRED Lab Daily Tribune", you would be less likely to believe the story. Now say you saw the same story from the "Creative Loafing" and you found reliable information for the source - you be more likely to believe it. By making sure legitimate newspapers are documented on Wikipedia, we make it quicker and easier to delineate between a real and fake news source. And, as we all know, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.92c6665c0563">fake news has a multitude of extremely dangerous effects. </a></p>

              Funded by donors Paul Haahr and Susan Karp, each page that is completed will garner a donation of $25 towards <a href="http://www.roomtoread.org/">Room to Read</a>, an organization that promotes literacy and gender equality in education, specifically in ten countries in the Asian and African continents. But, there's a time limit - pages have to be created before December 15, 2018. </p>

One of the best ways to help readers sort out whether a newspaper is real or fake is to check Wikipedia to see if it has an article (and what that article says). Having newspapers documented is also crucial to Wikipedia internally, since many historical claims are sourced to local papers, and editors require context on the nature of the publication the material appears in. This project, Local Historical Newspapers on Wikipedia (LHNOW) &lt;ref&gt;https://hapgood.us/2018/05/29/announcing-the-local-historical-newspapers-project-lhnp/&lt;ref&gt; will help to improve the quality and reliability of local news sources, particularly historic newspapers. <br><br>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Editing your first infobox</h2>
          <p>Ideally, we'll get to the point where we can create new pages from scratch. However, it's good to get some editing experience first - and Wikipedia requires an account to be 4 days old and have at least 10 edits before it can be used to create a new page. Thus, we'll start by editing infoboxes, which are also a crucial component because they feed information to the knowledge panels.</p><br>
          <p>The first step is to find a paper from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Newspapers/Needs_Infobox">this list</a> from the Wikipedia project page which lists all newspapers that need infoboxes.The infobox template will also be helpful.</p>
          <br>Skip down to <a href="#research">this page</a> to look for the necessary information for the infobox, and then this video will help you create the infobox and publish your changes!<br>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Where to find information</h2>
          <p>Wikipedia editors are STRICT about what qualifies as a legitimate source. Remember, the guiding principle of the editors is that Wikipedia should be an encycolpedia, but only for the "noteable" stuff. Thus, the better researched and backed up an edit is, the more likely it is to stick around. In general, the Library of Congress, local libraries, and Google Books are a great way to find information on local newspapers. In particular, for infoboxes, here are some good places to start looking for particular fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name, type, and format are usually pretty easy to find on the text of the paper's website.
                </li>
                <li> Foundation (when the paper was founded), owners, publisher, and editor should usually be on the about page of the paper's own website, but check to see if you have find them in local records.
                </li>
                <li>The political bias is usually obvious if there is a strong reference - you could scan the homepage briefly if you're not sure. 
                </li>
                <li>Circulation can be difficult to find; previously I've had luck with <a href="http://echo-media.com/medias/main_search/">Echo Media</a> by searing for the specific paper in the search bar on the homepage.
                </li>
                <li>Headquarters is usually on the "Contact Us" page of the paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ISSN is a serial number for magazines and newspapers, you can lookup a paper by name <a href="https://portal.issn.org/advancedsearch">here</a>.</li>
